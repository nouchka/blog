<a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">Socket.io</a> is a javascript web application on nodejs. It uses diffents transports methods depending on the browser.
  
I use it on 2 purposes:
  
&#8211; make browser client refresh some ressources when there are a change: a news section for example.
  
&#8211; alert when there are simultaneous change of a ressource: a change on a planning (http://www.katagena.com/setagaya/demo.php)

I have 2 projects using this technology:
  
&#8211; a dashboard with live status from different server: uptime values will refresh live
  
&#8211; a magento extension with live update

Native Socket.io allow javascript to send message but you can find libraries in different langages. As my backend is in PHP, I use the PHP library http://elephant.io/.

Recently, I was blocked by a strange bug: &#8220;This socket.io server do not support websocket protocol. Terminating connection&#8230;&#8221;
  
As my server is just installed, I though it was a version issue but it was easier:

ElephantIO Client has a function to check the server, function named handshake. This function will check http://yourserver:yourport/socket.io/1/ and expect a response like &#8220;at9Huwk8khVAa5-flPVZ:60:60:websocket,htmlfile,xhr-polling,jsonp-polling&#8221;. It shows the list of supported protocol: websocket is present.

So I check the url use by the library and I had &#8220;http://yourserver:yourport//socket.io/1/&#8221;, with an extra slash. The result page is quite different and show only &#8220;Welcome to socket.io.&#8221;. That&#8217;s why I got the error: not because server didn&#8217;t support websocket but just because url was wrong.

At the end, your code should be:

<pre>$elephant = new ElephantIOClient('http://yourserver:yourport', 'socket.io');</pre>

Not:

<pre>$elephant = new ElephantIOClient('http://yourserver:yourport/', 'socket.io');</pre>
